# FeedBack Logger Application

## FrontEnd React Application

The FeedBack Logger Application is a frontend React application that enables users to log feedback comments to a local database. It consists of multiple components that work together to provide a seamless experience for users. Additionally, the application calculates the average ratings and total number of reviews based on the logged feedback comments. This module can be easily integrated as a microservice into any application to facilitate feedback logging.

## Server-side Rendering using JSON Server

To enhance the performance and improve search engine optimization (SEO) of the application, server-side rendering (SSR) can be implemented using JSON Server. By integrating a server-side rendering framework such as Next.js, Nuxt.js, or Express.js with JSON Server, you can fetch data from the JSON Server and render HTML on the server. This approach offers benefits such as faster page loading times, better SEO visibility, and compatibility with clients that have JavaScript disabled.
